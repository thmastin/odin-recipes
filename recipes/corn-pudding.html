        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Corn PUdding is a Thanksgiving tradition in my wife's family. It has an undeniably sweet and creamy corn flavor, but with a firmer texture than a creamed corn. It's a perfect side for those big holiday meals where plates can get messy and overrun!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter, melted and slightly cooled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained</li>
            <li>2 (14.75 ounce) cans cream-style corn</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>1. Preheat Oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole dish</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs lightly in a large bowl. Add milk, melted butter, sugar, and cornstarch; whisk until well combined. Stir in drained corn and cream-style corn until fully blended. Pour mixture into the prepared casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour.</li>
        </ol>
